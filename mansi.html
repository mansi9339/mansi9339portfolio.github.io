	<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I am a Computer Science scholar. I try myself to be a modest, honest ,and hardworking human. I think being into the software industry is like being a magician you can create anything anytime only you need is knowledge and creativity and I am soo happy to be a part of this.
		I am always ready to learn new things as human get aged but knowledge doesn't.
		</p>
		<p>Apart from this, I am good at painting and sketching. In my free time I draw or sharp my skills. </p>
		<p>
		Currently, I am pursuing Btech computer science from Krishna Engineering  College, Ghaziabad (A.K.A. KEC) </p>
